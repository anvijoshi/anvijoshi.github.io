## üë©üèª‚Äçüíª What I'm doing

Currently, I'm designing an 8-week long Web Development course for Allgirlithm, an organization dedicated to making AI more accessible to minority groups. Specifically, I am developing lessons for HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. In addition to my work as a Patreon Content Creator for Allgirlithm, I am also a Graphic Designer for the team for which I am working on designs for Allgirlithm's website, blog, LinkedIn, and merchandise. I have also been working as an Outreach Ambassador for the student-led non-profit organization, Codenovate, where I advertise its educational initiatives such as virtual coding workshops. In addition to my work with tech organizations, I have been simultaneously completing a Web Development course on Udemy as well as Harvard University's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course. Aside from pursuing my interest in computer science, I have also been working on my chess blog, The Queen's Gambit, which is designed to empower girls to participate in the competitive chess community. Specifically, I have been working on the blog channel, #mychessqg, which provides various accounts of female chess players' experiences in order to encourage female participation. So far, my work has involved communication/outreach initiatives to potential blog contributors and advertising/designing social media posts for the blog.

## ü¶ï What I've done before

Throughout high school, I have been involved on my school's chess team, competing at local, regional, and state tournaments. In fact, I have been able to represent my school at several state tournaments, ranking 1st place in 2019 and 2nd place in 2018 out of the 275 schools in the Arizona Interscholastic Association.

I am also an active member of our school's Speech and Debate team, competing in local, regional, state, and national circuit tournaments in policy and public forum debate.
